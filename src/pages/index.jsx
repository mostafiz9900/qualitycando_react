            Berners-Lee circulated a document titled “HTML Tags,” which outlined
            just 20 tags, many of which are now obsolete or have taken other
            forms. The first surviving tag to be defined in the document, after
            the crucial anchor tag, is the paragraph tag. It wasn’t until 1993
            that a discussion emerged on the proposed image tag. In 1992, Tim
