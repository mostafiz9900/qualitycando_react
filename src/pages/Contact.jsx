                As designers, we are frequently and incorrectly reminded that our job is to “make
                things pretty.” We are indeed designers — not artists — and there is no place for
                formalism in good design. Web design has a function, and that function is to
                communicate the message for which the Web page was conceived. The medium is not the
                message. Never is this principle more pertinent than when dealing with type, the
                bread and butter of Web-borne communication. A well-set paragraph of text is not
                supposed to wow the reader; the wowing should be left to the idea or observation for
                which the paragraph is a vehicle. In fact, the perfect paragraph is unassuming to
                the point of near invisibility. That is not to say that the appearance of your text
                should have no appeal at all. On the contrary: well-balanced, comfortably read
                typography is a thing of beauty; it’s just not the arresting sort of beauty that
                might distract you

                with an emphasis on readability, and offer guidance on adapting them effectively for
                devices and screens. We’ll see that the ability to embed fonts with @font-face is
                not by itself a solution to all of our typographic challenges.

                Berners-Lee circulated a document titled “HTML Tags,” which outlined just 20 tags,
                many of which are now obsolete or have taken other forms. The first surviving tag to
                be defined in the document, after the crucial anchor tag, is the paragraph tag. It
                wasn’t until 1993 that a discussion emerged on the proposed image tag. In 1992, Tim
