                — Northwestern online MS in Info. Design Strategy QUICK SUMMARY ↬ In this article,
                I’d like to reacquaint you with the humble workhorse of communication that is the
                paragraph. Paragraphs are everywhere. In fact, at the high risk of stating the
                obvious, you are reading one now. Despite their ubiquity, we frequently neglect
                their presentation. This is a mistake. This is a mistake. Here, we’ll refer to some
                time-honored typesetting conventions, with an emphasis on readability, and offer
                guidance on adapting them effectively for devices and screens. We’ll see that the
                ability to embed fonts with @font-face is not by itself a solution to all of our
                typographic challenges. Be sure to check out the following articles: 8 Simple Ways

                titled “HTML Tags,” which outlined just 20 tags, many of which are now obsolete or
                have taken other forms. The first surviving tag to be defined in the document, after
                the crucial anchor tag, is the paragraph tag. It wasn’t until 1993 that a discussion
                emerged on the proposed image tag. More after jump! Continue reading below ↓ Meet

                Panel Bursting with imagery, motion, interaction and distraction though it is,
                today’s World Wide Web is still primarily a conduit for textual information. In
                HTML5, the focus on writing and authorship is more pronounced than ever. It’s
                evident in the very way that new elements such as article and aside are named. HTML5
                asks us to treat the HTML document more as… well, a document. It’s not just the
                specifications that are changing, either. Much has been made of permutations to
                Google’s algorithms, which are beginning to favor better written, more authoritative
                content (and making work for the growing content strategy industry). Google’s bots
                are now charged with asking questions like, “Was the article edited well, or does it
                appear sloppy or hastily produced?” and “Does this article provide a complete or
                comprehensive description of the topic?,” the sorts of questions one might expect to
                be posed by an earnest college professor. This increased support for quality
                writing, allied with the book-like convenience and tactility of smartphones and
                tablets, means there has never been a better time for reading online. The remaining
                task is to make the writing itself a joy to read.
